## Problem 1.

Write a factory function called `productFactory`
`productFactory` is expected to be invoked with 2 arguments `name` & `price`

Each object that it creates is expected ot have the following:

Properties: `name`, `price`

Methods: `increasePrice`, `decreasePrice`, `displayInfo`
  
`increasePrice` & `decreasePrice` accepts an `amount` as argument. As the name suggests, they increase or decrease the price of the object by amount.

`displayInfo` console logs and returns `<name> costs Rs.<price>`

## Problem 2.

Write a constructor function called `ProductConstructor`
`ProductConstructor` is expected to be invoked with 2 arguments `name` & `price`

Each object that it creates is expected ot have the following:

Properties: `name`, `price`

Methods: `increasePrice`, `decreasePrice`, `displayInfo`
  
`increasePrice` & `decreasePrice` accepts an `amount` as argument. As the name suggests, they increase or decrease the price of the object by amount.

`displayInfo` console logs and returns `<name> costs Rs.<price>`

## Problem 3.

Write a class called `ProductClass`
`ProductClass` is expected to be invoked with 2 arguments `name` & `price`

Each object that it creates is expected ot have the following:

Properties: `name`, `price`

Methods: `increasePrice`, `decreasePrice`, `displayInfo`
  
`increasePrice` & `decreasePrice` accepts an `amount` as argument. As the name suggests, they increase or decrease the price of the object by amount.

`displayInfo` console logs and returns `<name> costs Rs.<price>`


## General guidelines
- Example inputs are just for example. The tests may check the functions by invoking them with different inputs of the same shape.
- Before writing a single line of code please read the problem statement very carefully.
- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
